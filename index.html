                    <p style="font-size:20px">
                        Based on what we saw today in class there are a few things that I would have liked to change.<br />
                        Firstly, I would have adopted the idea that when a circle is added for a point in the hurricane, it would have made sense to have it change color and size based on windspeed and pressure for each point.<br />
                        I also would have modified the initial drawing of hurricane lines so that they changed color based on the windspeed of each point that made up the line.<br />
                        I think that once we ended up with an odd number of charts we should have changed our layout so that there wasn't a lone chart dangling below the map.<br />
                        The last thing I would have changed is I would have made the charts have larger lines so that they were more visible from the back of the room.<br />
                    </p>

                <p style="font-size: 20px">
                    1. Make changes to the line chart for it show the highest overall maximum windspeed per day and Minmum pressure per day.<br/>
                    2. Seprated the graphs from the main page map page where you could pull them up from the side.<br/>
                    3. Make the label on the graph scale according to how big the display was.<br/>
                    4. Make the overall map bigger
