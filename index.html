                        Based on what we saw today in class there are a few things that I would have liked to change.<br />
                        Firstly, I would have adopted the idea that when a circle is added for a point in the hurricane, it would have made sense to have it change color and size based on windspeed and pressure for each point.<br />
                        I also would have modified the initial drawing of hurricane lines so that they changed color based on the windspeed of each point that made up the line.<br />
                        I think that once we ended up with an odd number of charts we should have changed our layout so that there wasn't a lone chart dangling below the map.<br />
                        The last thing I would have changed is I would have made the charts have larger lines so that they were more visible from the back of the room.<br />
