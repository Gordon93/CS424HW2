                        <h4>Week 1</h4>
                        Assignment assigned. No group was formed at this point.

                        <h4>Week 2</h4>

                        Group was formed. Waiting for data to be parsed before beginning any work.
                        <h4>Week 3</h4>

                        Helped show Johnathan how to grab the data from the CSV file produced by Ryan Jones and bundle it into usable objects. This was important for finding out how to sort the hurricanes by year, name, or hurricane id.
                        Added clean navigation and a stylesheet to the website and each of its pages in order to create a consistent theme to the page site.
                        Began working as the "merge manager". The person in charge of fixing merge issues and making sure that the live page was updated for view by the rest of the team.

                        <h4>Week 4</h4>
                        Implemented the leafletplayback plugin that would allow for the playing of our hurricane points onto the map. Also modified the javascript of that plugin to allow for speeds that were conductive to the size of our data and the 6 hour difference in timestamps.
                        I linked this functionality to the modify functions so that the map would only playback those hurricanes that the user had already designated by selecting.
                        Continued to work as the "merge manager". The person in charge of fixing merge issues and making sure that the live page was updated for view by the rest of the team.
                        Led the presentation of our alpha product to the class.

                        <h4>Week 5</h4>
                        Reimplemented the animation of the map after taking out the leaflet plugin. Created the proper logic for a functioning start/pause button that will continue to draw the animated points from where the process was stopped. Instead of a moving marker, the play animation is now a placement of a small circle on the drawn line of the hurricane. This is so when the user selects a hurricane they do not lose view of it when they try to play the timestamps of that hurricane.
                        Created the sorting logic that makes sure that if hurricanes overlap that they will play the earliest point first, isntead of finishing the animation of one hurricane before moving onto another.
                        The timestamps also incorporate a speed slider that will allow the user to determine how fast the new points will appear.
                        Added a control view to the top right of the map so that the user can see the timestamps for each point as it is being drawn.
                        Continued to work as the "merge manager" making sure that there were no merge issues and that the live page was updated for view by the rest of the team.
